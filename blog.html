								<h1>BATTLE OF STUDIES</h1>
								<span>November 17, 2009</span>
								<p>Battle Studies, released on November 17, 2009, continues Mayer's exploration of emotional depth, but with a more personal and reflective tone. The album features a mix of soft rock and acoustic ballads, with a focus on relationships and self-exploration. Tracks like "Heartbreak Warfare," "Assassin," and "Perfectly Lonely" showcase Mayer's sharp lyrical insights and a more stripped-back musical style compared to Continuum. While Battle Studies didn’t receive the same level of critical acclaim as Continuum, it still solidified Mayer’s place as a skilled songwriter and performer, further cementing his status in the music world.</p>
